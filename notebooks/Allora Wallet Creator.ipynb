    "\n",
    "This notebook will lead you through the process of creating a **wallet** on Allora's network, and what to pay attention to. It is **not necessary** to use this notebook, this is just for extra information. Wallets are automatically managed by a **worker** node, whose job it is to provide inferences to the Allora network. It is part of [Allora's Python SDK](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-sdk-py) and installs with `pip install allora-sdk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All this happens automatically when launching your first worker using [the builder kit notebook](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-forge-builder-kit/blob/main/notebooks/Allora%20Forge%20Builder%20Kit.ipynb), but for a bare bones example, here you go.\n",

    "Code Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "from allora_sdk.worker import AlloraWorker\n",
    "from allora_sdk.ml_workflow.utils import get_api_key\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The worker automatically handles wallets. If you don't have a wallet, just hist <ENTER> when prompted for your menmonic phrase, and **a new wallet will be created automatically** and stored in the file marked `.allora_key`. If the key file exists, the worker will just run using that file. If you wish to enter a new mnemonic pass phrase, rename the `.allora_key` file to something else, the system will promopt you again for a new menmonic pass phrase.\n",

    " 1. The Address\n",
    " 2. The Menmonic Phrase (secret)\n",
    "\n",
    "The address is public. It identifies your worker on Allora's network. Browse the network with Allora's [network explorer](https://explorer.allora.network/) to find your wallet address. Never tell anyone your mnemonic pass phrase, only use it to run your worker and interact with the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Keep track of your wallet details. The address is what you will use to participate in the Forge competitions and get access to your funds later."
